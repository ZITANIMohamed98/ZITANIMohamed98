## Hi there 👋 My name is Mohammed Zitani
I am Software Developer using different Technologies such as Python, .Net, React, Next.js and I am a Ceritified Azure Developer (AZ-204 Certification) and I am preparing for the Azure DevOps Expert AZ-400 Certification hopefully I will be ready soon 😄 I am passionate about learning how things work under the hood and improve myself in areas that can make the best version of myself.
- 🔭 I’m currently working in Microsoft Azure Support as a Subject matter Expert in Azure Functions, Static Web Apps, this job is so interesting to me because I always get new issues, which is a little bit similar to when you are developing and you keep track of your bugs and try to solve them, this helps build a sense of investigation and quick reflex as the customers most of the time faces these issues in their production environments and they need a quick resolution
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .Net 8 and how to use it along different services such as Blazor, MAUI, Grpc, GraphQL and more technologies and I am working on improving my algorithmic skills by following the book https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230 which is so well written and has less math and theories which is great 😄.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and get my hands dirty in interesting projects. 
- 💬 Ask me about Azure Functions as I faced a lot of issues and I have some kind of experience with them.
